          I am a Colorado native and current student at the University of Denver enrolled in their full-stack coding boot-camp. 
          In my free time I enjoy learning new skills such as American Sign Language and the development of video games, working on personal goals and helping my community. 
          I enjoy hiking, camping and paddle-boarding. I enjoy spending time with family and friends playing board games like chess, and card games like cribbage and poker.
          <!-- Included a break between paragraphs -->
          <br /><br />
          After graduating from culinary school with a Bachelor's of Science in Food Service Management I decided on broadening my horizons and seeing the world. 
          I am a travel enthusiast with skills in business, marketing, and computer programming. I spent the last 10 years traveling both internationally and around the United States. 
          This enabled me to get a vast amount experience in different jobs as well as seeing different cultures and communities. 
          It has given my a wealth of knowledge in both business and customer service as well as hospitality. 
          I am eager to get started with my career in this field and am looking to using my skills to start a successful career in the Computer Programming and Technology Industry.
